## üí° Usage

```
Usage: spiko [OPTIONS] <URL>

Arguments:
  <URL>  Target URL.

Options:
  -n <N_REQUESTS>
          Number of requests to run. [default: 200]
  -c <N_CONNECTIONS>
          Number of connections to run concurrently. You may should increase limit to number of open files for larger `-c`. [default: 50]
  -p <N_HTTP2_PARALLEL>
          Number of parallel requests to send on HTTP/2. `spiko` will run c * p concurrent workers in total. [default: 1]
  -z <DURATION>
          Duration of application to send requests. If duration is specified, n is ignored.
          On HTTP/1, When the duration is reached, ongoing requests are aborted and counted as "aborted due to deadline"
          You can change this behavior with `-w` option.
          Currently, on HTTP/2, When the duration is reached, ongoing requests are waited. `-w` option is ignored.
          Examples: -z 10s -z 3m.
  -w, --wait-ongoing-requests-after-deadline
          When the duration is reached, ongoing requests are waited
  -q <QUERY_PER_SECOND>
          Rate limit for all, in queries per second (QPS)
      --burst-delay <BURST_DURATION>
          Introduce delay between a predefined number of requests.
          Note: If qps is specified, burst will be ignored
      --burst-rate <BURST_REQUESTS>
          Rates of requests for burst. Default is 1
          Note: If qps is specified, burst will be ignored
      --rand-regex-url
          Generate URL by rand_regex crate but dot is disabled for each query e.g. http://127.0.0.1/[a-z][a-z][0-9]. Currently dynamic scheme, host and port with keep-alive are not works well. See https://docs.rs/rand_regex/latest/rand_regex/struct.Regex.html for details of syntax.
      --max-repeat <MAX_REPEAT>
          A parameter for the '--rand-regex-url'. The max_repeat parameter gives the maximum extra repeat counts the x*, x+ and x{n,} operators will become. [default: 4]
      --dump-urls <DUMP_URLS>
          Dump target Urls <DUMP_URLS> times to debug --rand-regex-url
      --latency-correction
          Correct latency to avoid coordinated omission problem. It's ignored if -q is not set.
      --no-tui
          No realtime tui
  -j, --json
          Print results as JSON
      --fps <FPS>
          Frame per second for tui. [default: 16]
  -m, --method <METHOD>
          HTTP method [default: GET]
  -H <HEADERS>

  -D <BODY_PATH>
          HTTP request body from file.
  -T <CONTENT_TYPE>
          Content-Type.
  -a <BASIC_AUTH>
          Basic authentication, username:password
      --http-version <HTTP_VERSION>
          HTTP version. Available values 0.9, 1.0, 1.1.
